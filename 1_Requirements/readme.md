# Introduction
  A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More sophisticated calculators can handle exponential operations, roots, logarithm s, trigonometric functions, and hyperbolic functions.
# Research
## Objective
The prime objective of the calculator is to perform a number of calculations in response to user supplied input. The possible number of calculations is pre-defined. The results of the calculations may be presented in summary or detailed format. It is these outputs that are the main business functions of the calculator
# Benefits
This technology allows students solve complicated problems quickly and in an efficient manner. Additionally, it can reduce the problem to simpler tasks and allows the student to devote more time in understanding the problem.
# Cost and Features
The cost for implementing a project involving calculations is minimal to none. And for the required simple calculations this program comes in handy.
It's able to do simple arithmetic, which includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Use a basic calculator at home to figure out your monthly budget, or when you're trying to cook a new recipe.
# Defining our system
 Addition,subtraction,multiplication,and division are all possible with a basic calculator.
# Swot Analysis
## Strength
To make quick and accurate calculations.
## Weakness
Dependency.
